    <p> Here are some technical projects I have worked on: </p>

    <h1>LifeHack: MTG Life Counter</h1>
    <p>[iOS - Swift] Built my own version of a life tracking tool for the popular card game <i>Magic: The Gathering.</i> 
        This was my first time exercising the Swift language as I had been coding purely with Objective-C prior. This app is available on the App Store!</p>

    <h1>To Do List</h1>
    <p>[iOS - Swift] Used this project as a springboard to get back into iOS development, relearn Swift, and pick up on new procedures for writing tests. 
        This is a simple app which tracks a user's added, modified, and deleted to do items. It is primarily backed by a Table View and uses Core Data to 
        persist changes across sessions. </p>

    <h1>Flesh and Blood LITE</h1>
    <p>[React] Inspired by the named-after card game, <i>Flesh and Blood</i>, I recreated a simplified version utilizing 
        Object Oriented Programming to represent cards and various other attributes of the game. This game was built 
        in React as part of my first time learning the language.</p>

    <h1>Data Explorations: Netflix and Spotify</h1>

        from Netflix and Spotify.
