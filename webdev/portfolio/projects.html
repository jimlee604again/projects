    <p> Here are some technical projects I have worked on: </p>

    <h1>LifeHack: MTG Life Counter</h1>
    <p>[iOS - Swift] Built my own version of a life tracking tool for the popular card game <i>Magic: The Gathering.</i> 
        This was my first time exercising the Swift language as I had been coding purely with Objective-C prior. This app is available on the App Store!</p>

    <h1>Flesh and Blood LITE</h1>
    <p>[React] Inspired by the named-after card game, <i>Flesh and Blood</i>, I recreated a simplified version utilizing 
        Object Oriented Programming to represent cards and various other attributes of the game. This game was built 
        in React as part of my first time learning the language.</p>
